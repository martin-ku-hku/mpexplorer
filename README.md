# MP Explorer
A MicroPython blockly editor and WebREPL interface

MP Explorer is a blockly editor that helps novices programmers (kids or adults) to start programming in MicroPython on ESP8266. Try using it here:

This is primarily a web app, and it can run on its own once it's hosted on a web server. However, there are special codes specifically for porting the app to iOS and Electron. Change the booleans on top of `scripts/main.js` for different platforms.

While the technologies of building your own versions of MP Explorer aren't complicated, you may need to pay more attention to learning design to help learners learn better.
